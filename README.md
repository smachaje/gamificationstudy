A Study in Gameful Thinking :: Gamification (Amazon Alexa Skill)

Code instructions:

Use the Excel spreadsheet to create the content (questions).  The first column can be copied and pasted into the Alexa skill Custom Slot type called LIST_OF_ANSWERS.  The last column generates the code array to copy and paste into the skill.  Make sure to track quotes in the spreadsheet, double quotes will break the lambda code.
